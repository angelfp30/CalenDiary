# CalenDiary
CalenDiary is a project made to test my potential as a front-end developer, this could've been a good project to test back-end skills but I want to focus on the front just using localStorage to keep the data from the users.

The idea behind this webpage is that recently I wanted to make a registry of my habits, what do I do, a progress on my daily life, I looked for apps like this but I didn't find anything as I wanted, so I thought coding a web with those characteristics could be a good project.

This project is been made using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no frameworks or other tools.
